# Programming Exercise for OVCR by Jennilee Benda
This application is for a job application at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

## Instructions to run the application

After cloning the codebase, use the following steps to run the application.

1. If you do not already have node.js installed, go to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) website to install node.js. 
2. Open the node.js terminal and navigate to the directory where the code lives.
3. Run the command `npm run setup`
4. Once the application script is running, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in the browser of your choice.

## Notes about this application

Because I am primarily a web designer and developer, this application was created with create-next-app and coded using React and Next.js and basic HTML and CSS. Tailwind CSS was included but not used. When creating the CSS/Styling I used the branding colors found via [The UIUC Marketing website](https://marketing.illinois.edu/visual-identity/color)
