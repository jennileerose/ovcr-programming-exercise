# Programming Exercise for OVCR by Jennilee Benda
This application is for a job application at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

## Instructions to run the application

1. Click the green Code button at the top right of the repository and click download zip file

![download_codebse](https://github.com/jennileerose/ovcr-programming-exercise/assets/4683606/4ed0a8f7-9ce1-44a6-87b2-8642d7ffca8c)

2. Extract the files to a place on your PC where you can find them, such as your Documents or Desktop folder. (I'm using the documents folder in my example)

3. If you do not already have node.js installed, go to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) website to install node.js. 

    a. If you do have Node.js installed but an older version (older than 20), download the latest from the Node.js website and install it.

4. Once Node.js is installed, Open the node.js terminal from the Node menu in your start/apps menu (example image is from Windows 10).

5. Navigate to the directory where the code lives using `cd`. For example, I downloaded the code and extracted it into my documents folder so I would type: `cd Documents\ovcr-programming-exercise\ovcr-programming-exercise` (you have to do the repository name twice like that because of the way github nests things in their downloads)

6. In the terminal, run the command `npm install`

7. Then run `npm run startup`

6. Once the application script is running (it will say Ready like the screenshot below), navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in the browser of your choice.

## Notes about this application

Because I am primarily a web designer and developer, this application was created with create-next-app and coded using React and Next.js and basic HTML and CSS. Tailwind CSS was included but not used. When creating the CSS/Styling I used the branding colors found via [The UIUC Marketing website](https://marketing.illinois.edu/visual-identity/color)
